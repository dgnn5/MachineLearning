# MachineLearning
Goal: To make a functional Neural Network in Python from scratch (minimal imports and no frameworks).
Note: "Artificial Intelligence.py" is the skeleton of the Neural Network, whereas "SamanthaAI.py" is the fully implemented AI with training, etc.

Preface:
Neural Networks are a model of computing to allow computers to take input data and learn what the output data should be (ex: classifying shapes, predicting responses, interpreting large amounts of data). A Neural Network (at least this model of Neural Network (I believe this model is called a "dense fully connected" N.N.)) is made of 2 primary components: Nodes and Connections. The nodes are split into different layers; the Input-Layer, Hidden-Layers, and Output-Layer. Each node has an associated floating point value (typically bounded between 0 and 1). Each node is connected to every node in the previous layer. These connections have a floating point Weight and a floating point Bias to them (typically bounded between -1 and 1). The values of the nodes in the Input-Layer are set to values dependant on the training data. The value of every other node can be calculated from these input nodes and the weights and biases. By "Propogating" down the layers to the output layer, the value of the output layer nodes can be calculated, which are then interpreted dependent on the training data to figure out what the Neural Network predicts the output to be. This prediction is graded and averaged with all of it's other predictions from the data to determine the accuracy of this network. This accuracy is compared to many other networks to determine the best NN's, which are chosen to generate new NN's. This is repeated until the desired accuracy is achieved.

The training data for this project is in the form of 5 input integers (0-9 inclusive), and an output boolean. The value of the output was determined based on a variety of if's and elif's (such as "if the 1st number == the 2nd number and the 5th number times the 4th number == the third number", etc). Unfortunately the exact ifs and elifs have been lost to time, but the training data was saved. The goal was to get the NN to accurately predict whether any given input integers should output true or false.

Process:
First, I had to learn what an NN was and how it works, so I did a decent bit of research and learned a lot of the abstract concepts from a friend (who I was "competing" against with similar training data and restrictions on imports to see who could get the highest accuracy).
